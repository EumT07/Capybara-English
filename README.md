# Capybara English (Currently working on this project)

It is an interactive MVP web application that allows users to practice, learn, improve the pronunciation (I'm still learning how to do it) of English verbs in order to increase their vocabulary and improve their learning.

In this repository, you can see the whole process I did to build, invest and develop the project, I started by creating an excel table, then searching the information using different tools, but mainly, searching the info with the help of artificial intelligence, and then correcting step by step. 

I applied my python knowledge to be able to handle the data more easily, being able to get the info in JSON formats.

I will be adding new features, while improving my back-end and front-end skills, and of course, improving my English skills, this was my main motivation, trying to improve my pronunciation, so for me this project is just the beginning.

# Front-End
I used angular 18, while I was learning little by little with the project, I'm still learning because there are concepts that I still don't master very well, for the view I used html and css, adding and editing lines of code, I helped me with the AI (Deepseek, Gemini) to correct and learn responsive concepts, adapting to my main ideas.
